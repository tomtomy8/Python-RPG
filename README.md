Python RPG
==========

This is a game libary, built in Python and Pygame, specificly created
for Role Playing Games, specificly onces similar to JRPGs. 

This libary, as it is build in Pygame, is only compatible with Python 2.
Any other versions will not work, so if you only have Python 3 and wish to
use this libary you will have to download Python 2 as well.

Its very much at its first steps, however I will keep you updated in both
wiki and readme to its progress
